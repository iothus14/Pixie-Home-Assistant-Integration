# Awesome Lights

This integration shows how you would go ahead and integrate a physical light into Home Assistant.

If you use this integration as a template, make sure you tweak the following places:

 - `manifest.json`: update the requirements to point at your Python library
 - `light.py`: update the code to interact with your library

### Installation

```yaml
